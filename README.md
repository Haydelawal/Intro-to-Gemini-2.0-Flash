# Intro to Gemini 2.0 Flash

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook and related materials from the Google Cloud Skills Boost lab: **Intro to Gemini 2.0 Flash (GSP1290).**

## Overview

This lab introduces Gemini 2.0 Flash, a powerful new multimodal AI model from Google DeepMind, available through the Gemini API in Vertex AI. You'll explore its significantly improved speed, performance, and quality while learning to leverage its capabilities for tasks like text and code generation, multimodal data processing, and function calling. The lab also covers advanced features such as asynchronous methods, system instructions, controlled generation, safety settings, grounding with Google Search, and token counting.

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will learn how to use Gemini 2.0 Flash to:

* Generate Text and Code: Generate various forms of text, including streaming output, engage in multi-turn conversations, and write and execute code.
* Configure and Control model Behavior: Configure model parameters, set system instructions, apply safety filters, and utilize controlled generation techniques to tailor the model's output.
* Process Multimodal Data: Handle and process diverse data types, including text, audio, code, documents, images, and video.
* Interact Flexibly with the model: Adapt to various application requirements by employing both synchronous and asynchronous interaction methods.
* Ground Model Responses with Google Search: Improve the accuracy and recency of model responses by grounding them in real-world data from Google Search.
* Utilize Function Calling and Manage Tokens: Implement both automatic and manual function calling and learn to count tokens to track usage.
