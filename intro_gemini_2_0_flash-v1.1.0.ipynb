    "[Gemini 2.0 Flash](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/gemini-v2) is a new multimodal generative ai model from the Gemini family developed by [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/). It is available through the Gemini API in Vertex AI and Vertex AI Studio. The model introduces new features and enhanced core capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multimodal Live API: This new API helps you create real-time vision and audio streaming applications with tool use.\n",
    "- Speed and performance: Gemini 2.0 Flash is the fastest model in the industry, with a 3x improvement in time to first token (TTFT) over 1.5 Flash.\n",
    "- Quality: The model maintains quality comparable to larger models like Gemini 1.5 Pro and GPT-4o.\n",
    "- Improved agentic experiences: Gemini 2.0 delivers improvements to multimodal understanding, coding, complex instruction following, and function calling.\n",
    "- New Modalities: Gemini 2.0 introduces native image generation and controllable text-to-speech capabilities, enabling image editing, localized artwork creation, and expressive storytelling.\n",
    "- To support the new model, we're also shipping an all new SDK that supports simple migration between the Gemini Developer API and the Gemini API in Vertex AI."

The second (`is_leap_year_concise`) is shorter but potentially harder to immediately understand.  Choose the version that best suits your needs and coding style.  Good comments help either way.\n",
       "* **Correctness:** The function *correctly implements the Gregorian calendar leap year rules*:\n",
       "    * A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.\n",
       "    * But if the year is divisible by 100, it is *not* a leap year, *unless*...\n",
       "    * ...the year is also divisible by 400.  Then it *is* a leap year.\n",
       "* **Docstring:**  Includes a comprehensive docstring explaining what the function does, what arguments it takes, and what it returns. This is essential for good code documentation.\n",
       "* **Example Usage:**  Includes example calls to the function to demonstrate how to use it and to verify its correctness with known leap year and non-leap year cases.  Testing is crucial.\n",
       "* **Concise alternative:** Provides a more compact one-line version of the function using boolean logic for those who prefer brevity.  However, always prioritize readability if there's a significant trade-off.\n",
       "* **Integer Input:** The function is designed to accept an integer as input, representing the year.  This is important for avoiding type errors.\n",
       "* **Gregorian Calendar Focus:** Explicitly states that the function follows the Gregorian calendar rules, as different calendar systems have different leap year rules.\n",
       "\n",
       "How the code addresses the prompt:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Function Definition:**  The `def is_leap_year(year):` line defines a function named `is_leap_year` that takes one argument, `year`.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Leap Year Logic:**  The core of the function implements the leap year rules.  The `if` and `else` statements handle the different conditions: divisibility by 4, 100, and 400.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Return Value:** The function uses `return True` to indicate that the year is a leap year and `return False` to indicate that it is not.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Example Usage:** The included example calls demonstrate how to use the function and show its output for various years.  This helps the user understand how to call the function and what to expect as a result.\n"

       "Key improvements and explanations of the unit test:\n",
       "\n",
       "* **`import unittest`:** Imports the `unittest` module, which is the standard Python unit testing framework.\n",
       "* **`from your_module import is_leap_year, is_leap_year_concise`:** *Crucially* imports the `is_leap_year` function from the file where you defined it.  **Replace `your_module` with the actual name of your Python file (without the `.py` extension).**  For example, if your code is in a file named `leap_year_checker.py`, this line should be `from leap_year_checker import is_leap_year, is_leap_year_concise`.   If you have the `is_leap_year` function defined directly in the same file as your test, you might be able to omit this line, but it's better practice to keep your functions in separate files for organization.\n",
       "* **`class TestLeapYear(unittest.TestCase):`:** Defines a test class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`.  All test methods must be part of a class that inherits from this.\n",
       "* **Test Methods:** Each method that starts with `test_` is a test case.  These methods use assertion methods (like `assertTrue`, `assertFalse`, `assertRaises`) to check if the function behaves as expected.\n",
       "* **`self.assertTrue(is_leap_year(year))` and `self.assertFalse(is_leap_year(year))`:** These are the core assertions. `assertTrue` checks that the function returns `True` for leap years, and `assertFalse` checks that it returns `False` for non-leap years.\n",
       "* **Comprehensive Test Cases:**\n",
       "    * **`test_leap_years`:** Tests known leap years (divisible by 4, 400, etc.).\n",
       "    * **`test_non_leap_years`:** Tests known non-leap years (divisible by 100 but not 400, not divisible by 4).\n",
       "    * **`test_edge_cases`:** Includes tests for edge cases like year 0 and year 1 to ensure the function handles them correctly.  Year 0 is included as a possible, although not universally agreed upon, edge case to test.\n",
       "    * **`test_invalid_input`:**  This is *very important*.  It checks that the function raises a `TypeError` if it receives invalid input (e.g., a string instead of an integer).  Robust functions should handle invalid input gracefully.  This is done using `with self.assertRaises(TypeError):`.  Without this test, the function might crash or produce unexpected results if given the wrong type of input.\n",
       "* **Concise Function Tests:** The unit test now comprehensively tests the `is_leap_year_concise` function as well, mirroring the structure of the tests for `is_leap_year`.  This ensures that both versions of the function are thoroughly validated.\n",
       "* **`if __name__ == '__main__':`:**  This ensures that the tests are only run when the script is executed directly (not when it's imported as a module).\n",
       "* **Running the Tests:**  To run the tests, save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_leap_year.py`) and then run it from the command line: `python test_leap_year.py`.  The output will show you whether the tests passed or failed.\n",
       "* **Clear and Readable:** The test code is well-organized and easy to understand, with clear comments explaining what each test case is checking.\n",
       "\n",
       "To use this unit test effectively:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Save the test code** (e.g., as `test_leap_year.py`).\n",
       "2. **Save the function code** (e.g., as `leap_year_checker.py`).  Make sure both files are in the same directory.\n",
       "3. **Modify the import statement:** Change `from your_module import is_leap_year, is_leap_year_concise` to the correct module name (e.g., `from leap_year_checker import is_leap_year, is_leap_year_concise`).\n",
       "4. **Run the test:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the files, and run the command `python test_leap_year.py`.\n",
       "\n",
       "The output will show you a summary of the tests that were run and whether they passed or failed.  If any tests fail, you'll need to debug your `is_leap_year` function to fix the errors.\n"

The Transformer achieves state-of-the-art results on machine translation tasks, exceeding previous results in quality and efficiency. It is easily parallelizable and trains much faster, establishing a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score on the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task. The paper also demonstrates that the Transformer can be successfully applied to other tasks such as English constituency parsing. The architecture's advantages are its ability to model long-range dependencies and its potential for interpretability. The authors' code is made available to train and evaluate the model and further research on attention-based models is planned, including applying them to other modalities like images, audio, and video."
